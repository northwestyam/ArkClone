# ReCaveStory
## About the Project
ReCaveStory is a mod of the Pixel's Cave Story Game.  Based Christopher Hebert's tutorials, I plan to expand the game and learn more about 2D Game Architecture.  Also, I plan to deviate in game design as I become more familiar with the codebase.

## Game Architecture
1. This game will be built with C++.
2. I will be using gcc as my compiler. 
3. Parts of the Boost C++ library will be used.
4. I will adhere to the Google C++ Coding Guidelines.

## Game Art
You can use Pixel's sprites at www.cavestory.org!

## Dependencies
1. SDL1.3
2. SDL_image

## News & Updates
* 7/28/2016: I separated input into it's own class and the player class will now be in charge of actually moving the sprite.

# ArkClone
This is a remake of the arcade classic Arkanoid. I started with C++ and SDL1.3 and plan to build the entire original game.  This is my first game project originally written in C, but has been convereted to C++.

## To-Do
I need to rethink how I organized my code. My usage of global variables is not very safe and the UpdateBall() function is quite unwieldy.  

## Dependencies
* SDL1.3
* SDL_image
* SDL_mixer
* SDL_ttf

## In the next version!
I plan to update my programmer art to nicer programmer art and restructure my code in a more object-oriented way.
