# ArkClone
This is a remake of the arcade classic Arkanoid. I started with C++ and SDL1.3 and plan to build the entire original game.  This is my first game project originally written in C, but has been convereted to C++.

## To-Do
I need to rethink how I organized my code. My usage of global variables is not very safe and the UpdateBall() function is quite unwieldy.  

## Dependencies
* SDL1.3
* SDL_image
* SDL_mixer
* SDL_ttf

## In the next version!
I plan to update my programmer art to nicer programmer art and restructure my code in a more object-oriented way.
